# EasyPages

Hi, we are the `EasyPages` team - Daniel and Dmitrii.   

## Guide: 
The folder structure might seem a little weird.   
We made it so to separate each part of a project.   
The laravel project is stored in the respective folder and all the others - in others.   

### Project description:   
Basically, the system provides a way for the customers of certain companies to leave a personal review.
These reviews can be found by the community and discussed further in the comments.    
The companies posting the services should also be active on this website, which seems unlikely to happen, but whateva... 

### Wikis:  
Please, for some additional info, feel free to check our project's `wiki`.  
It is tiny, but there might be some interesting stuff.

*{{Maybe some more documentation will be added soon}}*
